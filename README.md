## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Discord bot token (you can create one at https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Basic knowledge of Discord server roles and permissions.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubprofile/discord-voice-management-bot.git
   cd discord-voice-management-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the bot:
   - **Create a `.env` File**:  
     Copy the example `.env` file and add your bot token:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Add your Discord bot token to the `.env` file:
     ```env
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
     ```

   - **Create a `config.json` File**:  
     Copy the example configuration file and update it with your server-specific details:
     ```bash
     cp config_template.json config.json
     ```
     Populate the `config.json` file with the following:
     ```json
     {
       "MUTE_LOG_CHANNEL_ID": 123456789012345678,
       "DETAIN_ROLE_ID": 123456789012345678,

       "VOICEMASTER_BOT_ID": 123456789012345678
     }
     ```
     Replace the placeholder IDs with the actual IDs for your server:
     - **MUTE_LOG_CHANNEL_ID**: Channel ID for mute/unmute logs.
     - **DETAIN_ROLE_ID**: Role ID for the detain role.
     - **DETAIN_LOG_CHANNEL_ID**: Channel ID for detain/undetain logs.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Usage Scenarios

### üé§ User Joins Voice Channel Muted
1. A user joins a voice channel while muted.
2. The bot detects this and unmutes the user automatically.
3. Logs the action in the "Mute Log" channel.
4. Sends a DM to the user notifying them of the unmute.

### üõ°Ô∏è Detaining a User
Note: You need to create a role called ‚ÄúDetained‚Äù in your Discord server. This role should have restricted permissions, such as no access to most channels except a specific ‚Äúdetention‚Äù channel (if desired). The bot assigns this role to users when they are detained.
1. A moderator uses `.detain @user` in any text channel.
2. The bot assigns the "Detain Role" to the user.
3. Logs the action in the "Detain Log" channel.
4. Sends a direct message to the user notifying them of the detain.
